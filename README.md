# Finance-Domain-Expert-
Fine-tuning and Deploying Meta Llama 2 7B Model for Finance with Amazon SageMaker
# Introduction
In the financial sector, leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs) like Meta Llama 2 7B can significantly enhance tasks such as market analysis, investment predictions, and risk management. These models, initially trained on extensive datasets, require fine-tuning on domain-specific data to optimize their performance for specialized tasks. This project documents the journey of fine-tuning Meta Llama 2 7B on a financial dataset, deploying it using Amazon SageMaker, and evaluating its text generation capabilities.

# Setup
Install Required Libraries
I ensured that the environment had the latest versions of the SageMaker and datasets libraries.
Authenticate AWS Services
Authenticated the session to access AWS services using the execution role associated with your SageMaker notebook instance.
import sagemaker, boto3, json
from sagemaker.session import Session

sagemaker_session = Session()
aws_role = sagemaker_session.get_caller_identity_arn()
aws_region = boto3.Session().region_name
sess = sagemaker.Session()
Test the Fine-tuned Model
Testing the fine-tuned model involves sending domain-specific queries to the endpoint and evaluating its responses.

# Define Response Function
Define a function to parse and print the model’s responses clearly.


# Select Dataset
For fine-tuning, choose a dataset that is specific to the financial domain. Ensure that your dataset is stored in an S3 bucket. Here’s an example path for a financial dataset.

Financial Domain: s3://your-bucket-name/training-datasets/finance
# Fine-tune the Model
Fine-tuning involves training the model on the financial dataset to tailor its knowledge for better performance in financial tasks.

Set Model and Estimator Parameters
First, define the model ID and version. Then, create an estimator with the required environment settings and hyperparameters.
# Specify the Dataset Path

Fill in the code below with the S3 path to your financial training dataset.
# Deploy the Fine-tuned Model
Once fine-tuning is complete, deploy the model to an endpoint for inference.
