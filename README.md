# Finance-Domain-Expert-
Fine-tuning and Deploying Meta Llama 2 7B Model for Finance with Amazon SageMaker
# Introduction
In the financial sector, leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs) like Meta Llama 2 7B can significantly enhance tasks such as market analysis, investment predictions, and risk management. These models, initially trained on extensive datasets, require fine-tuning on domain-specific data to optimize their performance for specialized tasks. This project documents the journey of fine-tuning Meta Llama 2 7B on a financial dataset, deploying it using Amazon SageMaker, and evaluating its text generation capabilities.

# Setup
Installed Required Libraries
I ensured that the environment had the latest versions of the SageMaker and datasets libraries.
Authenticated AWS Services
Authenticated the session to access AWS services using the execution role associated with your SageMaker notebook instance.
imported sagemaker, boto3, json

Tested the Fine-tuned Model
Testing the fine-tuned model involves sending domain-specific queries to the endpoint and evaluating its responses.

# Defined the Response Function
Defined a function to parse and print the model’s responses clearly.


# Select Dataset
For fine-tuning, accessed a dataset that is specific to the financial domain. Ensured that the dataset is stored in an S3 bucket. e.g
Financial Domain: s3://your-bucket-name/training-datasets/finance

# Fine-tune the Model
Fine-tuning involves training the model on the financial dataset to tailor its knowledge for better performance in financial tasks.

Set Model and Estimator Parameters
defined the model ID and version. Then, created an estimator with the required environment settings and hyperparameters.
# Specify the Dataset Path
Fill in the code below with the S3 path to the financial training dataset.

# Deploy the Fine-tuned Model
Once fine-tuning is complete,  the model was deployed to an endpoint for inference.

# Test the Fine-tuned Model
